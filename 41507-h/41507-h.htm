</p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> And so we must part forever!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> For the thirteenth time, my darling, I must, in reply
to that remark of yours, say&#8212;I don't see why.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Ah! Walter, you do not know who rules this house.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I may be wrong, but I was always under the impression
that your mother did.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Ah! then you do know. I was afraid you would think that
my poor father was the master of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I know that the house is let to your father; but I
confess, my dearest, that I have observed that he has sub-let himself
to your respected mother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> And she has declared that she will <i>never</i> give
her consent to our engagement.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> But your father has given his, and that is a great
point gained.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> It may be a great point, but it is a very useless one.
Mamma always has her own way. She pronounced her decision this morning,
and when you quit the house to-day orders will be given that you are
never allowed to enter it again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Then clearly I must not quit it. I am a great believer
in diplomacy, Emily. To go at the present time directly against your
revered mother's will would be utterly to lose you; to lose you, my
darling, would be far more than to lose my life; therefore, I have
determined to humor your respected parent, until the fortunes of war
give me an opportunity of ingratiating myself with her. Hush! She
approaches. Now rely upon me, and in every way back me up.
</p>

<p class="indent">
      (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Watmuff</span>, <i>door</i> <span class="smc">L.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> (<i>glaring indignantly at</i> <span class="sc">Walter</span>). Still
here, sir! I thought that you had been instructed by my husband to quit
these premises.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Madam, I am much to blame. That the wishes expressed,
I am sure, after mature deliberation, of Mr. Watmuff and yourself, have
been communicated to me, I cannot deny&#8212;and yet&#8212;I linger here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Linger no longer, sir; but obey our behest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I am, madam, about to do so; but since this interview
with my dear Emily must be my last&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> <i>Your</i> dear Emily! By what right, sir, do you
speak of my daughter as <i>your</i> dear Emily?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Because, mamma, I have consented&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> How, girl! This to my face? To your chamber, miss.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Again, madam, I have to own myself in the wrong. It is
<i>your</i> dear Emily to whom I have come to bid a long farewell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> A short farewell, sir, is all that is necessary&#8212;and
more than I shall allow. My domestics will have instructions to remove
you, within five minutes, from this domain. What ho! there&#8212;cook and
serving-maid!
</p>

<p class="indent">
      (<i>Exit</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Watmuff</span>, <i>door</i> <span class="smc">L.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Walter, surely you do not mean to give me up!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> My darling, do you&#8212;can you&#8212;doubt me? I shall never
give you up; but I am convinced that our only course is to temporize.
Your mother is, to say the least of it, arbitrary; but does she not
give me a glorious chance of proving the strength of my affection for
you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> How, dearest?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I am prepared to marry you, my darling, even during
her lifetime.
</p>

<p class="indent">
      (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Mr. Watmuff</span>, <i>door</i> <span class="smc">R.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Oh, papa, I am in sad trouble. Mamma still withholds
her consent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My dear child, your mother, with the exception of her
tongue, has a habit of withholding everything.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> And she has ordered Walter to quit the house.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Well, my dear, beyond a not unnatural feeling of envy
for Walter, I don't feel that I can express any sentiment on the
subject. I have given my consent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> But of what use is it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Not much, my dear, I must own. But I thought you might
derive some comfort from it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Do you know that mamma is now giving orders to the cook
and housemaid to remove poor Walter by force?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My dear child, it is, I must admit, an extreme measure.
But what can I do?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> You ought not to brook such treatment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Dearest love, I don't know that I do brook it; because
I never mastered the full meaning of that word. But even if I did, how
can I unbrook it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> My dear sir, I think I comprehend your position better
than poor Emily does; and, indeed, I have been trying to persuade her
that our better plan is to yield to the storm until it has passed. We
must remember the old fable of the oak and the willow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> It has been Mrs. Watmuff's good fortune to dwell in a
perfect grove of willows since the day of her birth. I confess that I
have yielded so long that I am limp with yielding.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> And I mean to yield only so far as to retain strength
for a final spring, and a final growth in a right and firm direction.
Come, Emily, be guided by me, and I promise you all shall be well. If I
remain here a moment longer I fear the storm may burst, and at present
we are both too oak-like to stand it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
      (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="sc">Emily</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Walter</span>,
      <i>door</i> <span class="smc">R.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> That's a remarkably sanguine young man; but, then, he's
at the sanguine time of life. I was sanguine myself once&#8212;remarkably
sanguine; and then I married Mrs. Watmuff&#8212;or, rather, I should say,
she married me. I believe that there is a ceremony which, in polite
language, is termed asking the dearly-beloved object of your affections
"the momentous question," and in vulgar parlance is called "popping the
question." I may honestly say that I neither popped nor momented.
Looking back on a long vista of years, I cannot for the life of me
remember any period when I was engaged; I only remember being free, and
being&#8212;well&#8212;married. Marriages, they say, are made in Heaven. I don't
want to be irreverent, but sometimes I can't help wishing that Heaven
had left me, as the charity cards say, "totally unprovided for." But my
provision approaches.

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My love, I am given to understand that she also is of

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> But, my love, on what grounds? On what grounds?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Grounds, Mr. Watmuff&#8212;grounds! You speak of your
daughter as though she were so much coffee. Is it not enough that I
object to the addresses of this young upstart?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My dear, it is quite enough. I may say that it is more
than enough. But what was I to do? I always liked Walter. You know that
I dote on Emily. They come to me, tell me that they love each other,
and ask for my blessing. I happen to have a blessing by me, and I give
it them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> And without a thought of me&#8212;<i>me</i>, the partner of

You have no right to dispose of a blessing of your own, Mr.
Watmuff&#8212;you have not got one. Such a blessing is a curse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Well, my love, whatever it is, they've got it, and they

<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> A truce, by all means; but as for Walter Litherland&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Walter Litherland never marries daughter of mine, Mr.
Watmuff. It is enough. I have said it. I married to gratify my parents.
Emily will marry to gratify me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My love, may I, with all deference, venture to remind
you that your respected and beloved parents were, when I first had the
pleasure of making your acquaintance, what may be called "no more."

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Oh, and was <i>I</i> one of them?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> In the abstract, yes. What did I find you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My dear, don't allude to that. You did not find me
much; but I am not an avaricious man, and as I said at the time, what I
looked for in a wife was not so much money as&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Sordid one! Ever thinking of your worldly goods. When
I ask, what did I find you? I allude to your moral condition. You were
a smoker of tobacco. Do you deny it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>regretfully</i>). I used to enjoy a cigar.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> You were a bibber of wine. Was it not so?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>regretfully</i>). A glass of port now and then was
very pleasant to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> It was such as <i>you</i> that my parents hated. It
was such as <i>you</i> they loved to reform. It is the custom of some
to erect to the memory of their parents costly monuments of marble, and
gaudy windows of perishable glass. <i>I</i> erected <i>you</i>. Say,
have I altered you? Do you smoke now?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>very mournfully</i>). I do not.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> In my cellar. It has remained there, my love, since,
twenty years ago, you appropriated the key; and (<i>with a groan</i>)
it must be in very fine condition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Ay! you can still think of the condition of your port;
lucky for you that I have thought of <i>your</i> condition. You are a
mausoleum, Mr. Watmuff, of which my parents may feel justly proud.
Their tomb will not be neglected during the lifetime of their daughter.
My decision with regard to Walter Litherland is one more
<i>immortelle</i> woven, by loving hands to their memory. You are a
mausoleum, Mr. Watmuff. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Watmuff</span>, <i>door</i>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> A mausoleum, am I? I wish they'd put a railing round me
then, and keep me isolated. I'm always being railed at. Why, if I'm
regarded from that point of view, can't I be railed in? I haven't the
privileges of a family vault. I'm only a common grave, walked over and
trampled on by everybody. It's too bad. It would be rough enough on a
grave, but on flesh and blood it's outrageous. And when I think of that
cellar of port, d&#8212;d if I don't wish I was buried&#8212;with it. How crusty
it must be now! As crusty, I expect, as I ought to be if I only dared
to show my teeth.

hear about it. Have a cigar? (<i>Offers cigar-case to</i>

not smoke at present.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Certainly not. My aunt, is, after all, one of the family,

just the thing which I want to make.

and the greater the tact the less need for time. Mine is a pure case of
tact.

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I trust the fortune is intact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, no, it isn't; because it is what you may call <i>in

dead certainty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>who during this conversation keeps on pinching his

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, I've made an important discovery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Bravo, Ferdinand!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> An inventor? Sir, I congratulate you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, perhaps I ought to say that I've made an important
discovery that another fellow has made an important discovery. All the
States are wild about it; and, as he was an intimate friend of mine,
and always said he would like to do me a good turn, I, without
bothering him about it, noted down the particulars and came over to
England to introduce it as <i>my</i> discovery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> How will he like that?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Probably not at all. But inventors and discoverers are
proverbially discontented and disappointed men, and he mustn't fight
with destiny.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> But what is it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Frost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> and <span class="sc">Walter</span>. Frost?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Exactly. Frost. Frost applied to freezing. Of course you
know that a lot of American meat is now shipped to England. Much
cheaper meat than English meat, and, consequently, big fortunes to be
made out of the process. But it isn't altogether satisfactory, because
it's difficult to preserve the meat during the voyage. Goes bad, you
know; gets high, and that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> High in price, do you mean?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, a little bit in that way, perhaps; but decidedly
high in another. Very good. To the speculative American mind it
becomes, therefore, a matter for conjecture, how is such evil to be
overcome? An American with more than usually speculative and powerful
mind gets over the difficulty. Frost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Frost?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Frost. Liquid discovered which, injected into the ear of
animal, freezes him <i>pro tem.</i>, and suspends the beggars animation
for as long as you please. Freeze and suspend your animal in
America,&#8212;unfreeze him in England by simple process of another liquid,
and a warm bath,&#8212;he lives again,&#8212;you kill him,&#8212;and get fresh meat.
Important to every man who keeps horse, cow, sheep, or
pig,&#8212;<i>vide</i> advertisement of company, whose motto is, "Not lost,
but gone before."<span class="ralign">(<i>All rise.</i>)</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> That hardly strikes me as appropriate, because under
the old system the meat usually was "gone" before&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Before reaching destination. Good. Motto must be altered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> But, Ferdinand, surely you are not going into the meat
trade?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Certainly not. Mark the small mind. Can't see further
than the bare facts stated in preliminary prospectus. My view is to
adapt the discovery to the human being.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Impossible! And what would be the good of it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> (<i>taking their arms and walking up and down</i>). Quite
possible, and the good of it simply incalculable. Father of family
finds things bad,&#8212;freezes, or suspends animation of family, and puts
them on shelves until times mend. Man thinks he ought to give up
horses, but doesn't like to sell old favorites,&#8212;freezes, or suspends
their animation till price of hay and corn comes down, and things
generally go up. Man has wife who makes things unpleasant at
home,&#8212;freezes or suspends his animation till she comes round.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> There is hardly novelty in that notion. Men before now
have, under such circumstances, suspended themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> With a rope. Yes. But how much better is my plan! A few
drops of this colorless liquid (<i>producing bottle</i>) injected into
lobe of ear of patient will freeze, or suspend animation of patient,
during will of practitioner. Remedy, few drops of another liquid
injected into lobe of other ear, and warm bath.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Upon my soul, it's a grand idea.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> The great difficulty which you will have to deal with
will be to get some one to submit himself to the experiment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Walter, you're a sharp fellow. You've hit the right nail
on the head. That <i>is</i> the difficulty. It is really astounding how
blind and how selfish people are in advancing the interests of science.
In the States they can't get a soul to try it, and they've got to wait
for the first felon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> The first felon?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Yes. First man condemned to death, you know. Then they'll
give him his choice&#8212;suspend his animation either by rope or patent
freezing mixture. If he recovers from the latter, give him his life and
liberty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Then you admit that there is a certain amount of risk
attached to the experiment?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> I admit nothing of the sort. There isn't the least risk.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Then why do not <i>you</i> submit yourself to the
ordeal?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Damme, sir, don't you understand that as the proprietor
of the patent I couldn't safely show any one how to bring me to life
again? There's only one man could do it, and that's the American
inventor; and he's such a devilish grasping fellow that when he hears
I've brought the thing over here without consulting him, he'd be
capable of keeping me suspended indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Then how do you mean to proceed?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Oh! look out for a felon. England is the best field for
that sort of thing, and that's why I came over here. I'm not going to
ask any more private individuals. I'm sick of it, and won't give myself
the pain of receiving any more refusals. I confess I've buoyed myself
up with the hope that I should find a felon in my own family, which
would make things easy and pleasant for me. Is there one, uncle? I said
good-by to a lot of cousins who promised well in that direction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> No, Ferdinand, there isn't one.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Hard lines, because there must be one soon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> But, failing a felon, what shall you do?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> I see only one course open&#8212;I must marry, and freeze my
wife.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> You would have sufficient confidence in the project,
sir, to try the experiment on your wife?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Damme, sir, that's my difficulty. I should have to bring
her round again to prove the success of the discovery; and I've a
perfect horror of matrimony.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Upon my soul, you know, this strikes me as being
exceedingly interesting, and I really think that some one ought, in the
cause of humanity, to come forward and submit himself to the
experiment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> My dear uncle, you charm me. You evidently mean to place
yourself in the light of the felon of the family whom I hoped to find;
and, considering that you are not a felon, I really take it very
kindly. When shall I inject&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> No, no, Ferdinand; don't misunderstand me. As a man,
and as a father, I don't feel justified in suspending my animation even
for a minute. No one knows what might happen during that minute; it
might be necessary to realize an investment, or to indorse a check,
or,&#8212;in fact, I couldn't forgive myself if anything went wrong while I
was indulging in the mere gratification of a whim. But it has struck me
that your aunt&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> My aunt! We couldn't hit on a better subject. I should
inject my fluid into the lobe of the right ear; I should light a cigar,
and, by the time the cigar was finished, I should think of injecting
the other fluid into the lobe of the left ear, and of resuscitating the
patient.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Oh, you would light a cigar, would
you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, yes, I think so.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> And naturally you would ask me to smoke with you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, yes, naturally.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). Ferdinand, do you like a glass of
good wine with a cigar?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Well, naturally, yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Ferdinand, I feel that it is my duty to help you in
this worthy enterprise. I have explained why I cannot myself become a
subject for your experiments; but I do think that your aunt&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> My dear uncle, do you think you could induce her&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> For Heaven's sake, do not talk of inducement, or you
will spoil all. I say advisedly <i>all</i>. It must be done by
compulsion, or say rather, tact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Certainly, uncle, say rather, tact. Only tell me how to
show tact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>). Listen. Your aunt has lately, to do
her justice, suffered from neuralgia. In common with the majority of
her sex, she is willing to try any absurd remedy which is suggested to
her. Tell her that a drop of your fluid injected into the lobe of the
right ear will cure neuralgia, and she will take it like a lamb.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Best of uncles, this is glorious. How shall I thank you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> I only make <i>one</i> condition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> And that is?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Don't unsuspend her until the smell of our&#8212;I mean
<i>your</i> cigar, has passed off.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> I give you my word.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> And remember, I am only induced to make this temporary
sacrifice of my own happiness in the interests of science.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> And of your nephew?

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> That seems to be a very enterprising and pushing young
gentleman, and one likely to make his way in the world. But what a
shocking old villain my future father-in-law turns out to be! He really
seems to relish the idea of performing this awful experiment on his
unfortunate wife. She may be a trying woman, but she doesn't deserve to
run such a risk as this. Now what am I to do? Clearly I can't be an
accomplice in a thing of this sort. Freezing my mother-in-law! And
equally clearly I must put a stop to it; but the difficulty is, how am
I to do it without offending old Mr. Watmuff, who is my only friend in
the house? (<i>Notices that</i> <span class="sc">Swift</span> <i>has left his bottle
on table</i>.) Ah! an idea strikes me; if I could only have a moment
with Mrs. Watmuff I might tell her, and so ingratiate myself with her.

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Still here, sir? Was not my mandate sufficiently clear
to you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> My dear Mrs. Watmuff, I am indeed lucky thus to meet
you at this moment, and we may both be thankful that I did not leave
the house when you told me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> How, sir? I do not comprehend you. You speak in
parables.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> I speak in great haste, madam, and I beg of you to
listen to me. Every moment is of vital importance, and I do not
hesitate to say that your life may depend on hearing me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> My life, sir? I do not dread death, young man. My
parents dreaded it not. It came, and they accepted it; and so in due
season shall I accept it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> But, Mrs. Watmuff, it may come to you in very undue
season. To be brief with you, I have discovered that at this very
moment, in this very house, a horrible plot is being concocted which
may cost you your life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> A plot! How say you? And who, then, are the
conspirators?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> You have a nephew named Ferdinand Swift&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> A hare-brained adventurer. He is in the other
hemisphere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> He has returned, and is in this house. He has brought
with him some wild American invention with which he proposes to make
his fortune. Do you see this bottle?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> I observe a phial, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> This bottle contains a fluid which will, so says your
nephew, if injected into the ear, freeze or suspend the animation of
the subject so operated on, until another fluid, injected into the
other ear, restores life. The difficulty is to persuade any one to
submit himself to so hazardous an experiment; but he has so excited the
curiosity of Mr. Watmuff, that he has consented that <i>you</i> should
be subjected&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> <i>He</i> has consented? I gather, sir, that my
consent would also be necessary.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Here comes the base part of it. You are not to be
told. Swift is to suggest that you should use his precious fluid as a
remedy for neuralgia. For Heaven's sake, refuse to use it, for any one
who does would do so at the peril of his life. Good-by, madam. I
believe that my warning is a timely one, and I am thankful to be the
means of rendering you this small service.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> A timely warning, truly! I feel as one in a trance. I
have long doubted the fidelity of Mr. Watmuff,&#8212;I have long understood
the duplicity of his character,&#8212;but I had not thought him capable of
such vile machinations as these. Cold-blooded miscreants!&#8212;they would
suspend my animation, would they? Oh, Mr. Watmuff, you must be read a
bitter lesson for this. It will be hard for me to take a part in a
masquerade, but the memory of my parents demands this <i>immortelle</i>
from me. (<i>Takes up the bottle, empties it of its contents, and fills
it up from a bottle of water which is on table.</i>) Yes, I will affect
to be deceived by your blandishments, and you shall think that you have

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Oh, there you are, my dear. I've been looking for you
everywhere. I wanted to tell you Ferdinand Swift had unexpectedly
arrived in England.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> And I need hardly say, my dear aunt, that my first desire
was to come and pay my respects to you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> You are welcome, nephew.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> I think you'll say that again, my dear, when you hear
of what Ferdinand has brought with him. You must know that he is the
bearer to England of, and is about to introduce to this country, a most
extraordinary remedy&#8212;for what do you think?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> How should I hazard a conjecture, Mr. Watmuff?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> For neuralgia! There! isn't that good news?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> It would, indeed, be a boon, could some efficacious
specific be found to war with that most terrible disorder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> My dear aunt, it has been found. It may seem a curious
thing to say, but, when I inquired after your health&#8212;which, of course,
I did the moment I came into the house&#8212;and my uncle told me that you
suffered from neuralgia, I was positively <i>glad</i> to know that I
could be the happy means of at once and permanently relieving you from
all pain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> If what you say is true, nephew, you will be a
benefactor to suffering humanity. You should deem yourself very
fortunate to be such an instrument.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> My dear aunt, I do think myself fortunate. To be running
about from morning to night, as I am, continually relieving my fellow
creatures from the excruciating pangs of neuralgia, makes life one long
summer's day of happiness. It makes me so light-hearted that I'm always
singing, or humming, or whistling, and so I'm known among my friends as
the musical instrument.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> And what, may I ask, is your remedy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> The simplest thing in the world. You take&#8212;(<i>feeling in
his pocket for bottle</i>)&#8212;Hullo! By Jove!&#8212;(<i>seeing bottle on
table</i>)&#8212;Ah! yes, to be sure, I left it here. You take two or three
drops of this colorless fluid, make the smallest of punctures in the
lobe of the right ear, inject it, and the pain goes as if by magic. If
you are suffering now, aunt&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> I am always suffering.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Then let me try.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Yes, my dear. Let Ferdinand try.

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> It is your <i>wish</i> that I should do so, Mr.
Watmuff?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> My dear, of course it is. I would give anything to see
you free from pain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> It is enough; my husband's wish is law to me. (<span class="sc">To
Ferdinand.</span>) Apply your remedy, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> With pleasure. (<i>Brings down large easy-chair.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter</span> (<i>aside, appearing from behind screen at back</i>). I
am glad I made up my mind to see through this. Upon my soul, I'm
beginning to admire Mrs. Watmuff. What ruffians these men are!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Now, my dear aunt, sit in this chair, and lean back. You
will soon be free from pain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Yes, my love, do just as Ferdinand tells you, and you
will soon be free from pain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> (<i>operating</i>). All that you will feel is one sharp

but I have an awful time of it with this woman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> I don't doubt you. I've always considered my aunt as the
most unpleasant person of my acquaintance. (<i>Lights a cigar.</i>)
Smoke, uncle?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Thanks, Ferdinand. (<i>Lights cigar.</i>) Ah! That's
real enjoyment. That's the first cigar I've smoked since I married your
aunt. She never would let me. Would it bring her to if I blew some
smoke in her face, Ferdinand?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Not at all. Only the infallible mixture will restore her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>blows smoke of cigar into</i> <span class="sc">Mrs.
Watmuff's</span> <i>face</i>). There! There! There! There! That's done me
a lot of good, Ferdinand, and now we'll have a glass of wine. (<i>Puts
his hand into</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Watmuff's</span> <i>pocket and produces

and has kept it ever since; but, by Gad, I'll have a duplicate made
now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Quite right; but before you get the wine, let's put the
old woman away somewhere. In the first place, she isn't a pleasant
sight; and, in the second place, if any one came in they might be
startled. Where shall she go?

part of the business carefully,&#8212;that's the one objection to the
process. A frozen body like this would break to pieces if you dropped
it, and you don't want that.

wonderful discovery of yours. You see, your aunt&#8212;

pleasant to have things quiet like this. (<i>Drinks.</i>)

your tone rather relieves me. I am delighted with the success of the

together again, I can see you won't so much mind.

that I've got you into a bit of a mess, but it's all in the interests
of science, you know. I'll go to the hotel at once, and try and find my

sight of it. Who can tell how you might be misunderstood?

that while you are taking a journey to America and returning, I am to
remain here keeping guard over your poor aunt's body?

<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Damme, sir, yes. I've had a skeleton long enough, and
I've done my best to bear it&#8212;but I never expected my cupboard to
contain a frozen wife, and under the circumstances I don't know how to
conduct myself.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Confound it, uncle, you've no imagination. Say she's gone
out for a walk.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> And supposing your ship is wrecked, and you and your
d&#8212;d bottle go to the bottom?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> In that case, uncle, I can only wish you well; and,
believe me, I will do so. I won't worry you any more now, for your
hands are full, and you will like to be left alone to form your own
plans. Farewell. If I'm not back with the bottle in ten minutes, think

through my disordered mind, my brain is on fire, and I feel that I am
going mad. One chance, and one only, remains to me. Ferdinand
<i>may</i> find the remedy at his hotel: if so, he and my poor wronged
wife will want a warm bath. Thank goodness, there is one thing that I
can do. I will go and see that the water is hot. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="sc">Mr.

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> (<i>aside</i>). How! He here again? Now can I learn
the real sentiments of these young people. I do not forget the timely

me.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter</span> (<i>aside to</i> <span class="sc">Emily</span>). It's all right; she's
still there; I heard her. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Let us sit, dearest
(<i>places two chairs close to cupboard</i>), and I will explain to you
all that I mean&#8212;all that I feel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Walter, I will do so, because I know that our parting
is at hand; otherwise, after my dear mother's expressed wish that we
should see each other no more, I could not have consented to converse
alone with you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Your tender allusion to your mother, Emily, makes my
task a comparatively easy one. I confess that my object in seeking this
interview was that I might, tenderly and devotedly, bid you farewell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> I knew it. Something in your manner, Walter, told me
that it was to be so; and though my heart will break at our parting, I
shall know that it is only some wise purpose which induces you to leave
me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Emily, it is right that I should tell you all. You
have alluded to your mother. You know that in the first delirium of my
love for you I was inclined&#8212;God forgive me!&#8212;to resent the manifest
objections which that honored lady showed towards my pretensions.
Hot-headed fool that I was, Emily, I cruelly misjudged her. I thought
that her objections were mere prejudices. Circumstances have since come
to my knowledge which have convinced me that&#8212;though we cannot yet
quite see why&#8212;she is right, and that, distress us as it may, we are in
duty bound to bow before her greater experience, and to yield to her
wisely dispensed commands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> Walter, an inward voice tells me that you are right.
Without asking why, we ought to acquiesce in her views. Sometimes I
fear that my poor mother's life is not so happy as it should be.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Walter.</span> Indeed it is not. Your father&#8212;but no, I can at least
spare you the pain of that sad story. We are both familiar with your
dear mother's loving and tender allusions to the memory of her parents.
May you, in years to come, enjoy the same proud privilege! May I, when
old and gray-headed, at least be able to think that I left my Emily in
that luxury, a lifelong legacy! And now, my dearest, I shall kiss you
once, and bid you a last good-by.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> No, Walter; you will not kiss me. At such a season as
this, when we have agreed to part, such an act would be on your part
unmanly, on mine unmaidenly. I will open the street door for you; more
I cannot do.

<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Undone? Not a bit of it. Overdone, I should say, from the
look of you. Don't be an old lunatic. Pull yourself together. Look
here&#8212;(<i>shaking him</i>)&#8212;it's all right; I've found my other bottle;

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> (<i>having rushed to cupboard and inspected it</i>). Good
gracious! This is most serious. What infernal carelessness! Who did it?
and who allowed it to be done? Do you know, you demented old ass, that
in that state, my poor aunt was as brittle as glass; and if she's been
dropped, or even knocked up against anything, or, for the matter of
that, even jolted, she would break into ten thousand pieces! Who's to
blame for this, I should, like to know?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>with a groan</i>). I know, Ferdinand, <i>I</i> am.
I am what you came to England to look out for, the first felon. Freeze

frozen.

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> No, but hang it, this is a serious matter to me. It's a
direct infringement on my patent. That's what it is. Who brought you
round? Sentiment is sentiment,&#8212;but damme, justice is justice; and I
mean to know who brought you round, and then prosecute him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Silence, miscreant. I have not, as you put it, been
brought round, because, your vile scheme having been frustrated, I was
never rendered insensible. The liquid in your life-destroying phial,
Ferdinand Swift, was cast away by these hands, and pure and innocent
water took its place.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> Then you never were frozen?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Only so far as genuine horror can freeze.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> But you went off?

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> It was a masquerade&#8212;

<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> What! Do you mean to say that you were sensible all the
time that&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> I was conscious during the entire period. I was
conscious, Mr. Watmuff, when you were gloating and exulting over what
you believed to be my lifeless body.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>sinks in chair, and buries his face in his
hands</i>). Oh, don't! Spare me! spare me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> I was conscious, Mr. Watmuff, when you abstracted from
my pocket the key of the cellar.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> (<i>groaning</i>). Oh, don't! don't!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> I heard you, Mr. Watmuff, express your determination
to possess yourself of a duplicate to that key. (<span class="sc">Mr. Watmuff</span>
<i>groans</i>.) I heard you descend to the wine vaults, and was
conscious of your return with beakers and flagons containing wine.
(<span class="sc">Mr. Watmuff</span> <i>groans</i>.) I was conscious of the vile odor
of tobacco pervading these rooms, which hitherto I had kept free from
such pollution; and, mark this well, Mr. Watmuff, I was more than
conscious <i>when the smoke from your cigar, ejected from your lips,
designedly suffused my countenance</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> Oh, this is too much! Ferdinand, do me a kindness. You
are on the look-out for some one who does not object to be frozen. In
the interests of science, I'm quite prepared to immolate myself. Freeze
me, and I'll bless you as long as you keep me frozen.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> (<i>approaching</i> <span class="sc">Emily</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="sc">Walter</span>). Lastly, I was conscious when these dear ones
(<i>embraces them</i>) revealed themselves to me in their true colors,
and I learned that it was consistent with my duty to my parents to give
them my blessing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Emily.</span> I need not tell you, papa, how happy this makes me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mr. W.</span> I'm very glad, my dear, to know that one member of the
family is likely to be happy. Now, Ferdinand, I'm quite ready. Freeze
me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Fer.</span> With pleasure. You will feel one sharp prick in the
lobe&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Mrs. W.</span> Hold, hateful trifler with the sacred laws of nature!
Is such a man as that <i>fit</i> to be frozen? I will freeze you when
we are alone, sir! Ah, sad it is, when the old must be taught by the
young, and that the daughter's lot should be happier than the mother's!
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Emily</span>.) And yet, my child, I do not grudge you your
happiness, and am glad at heart to think that you will have a husband
who declined to take part in the diabolical scheme for Freezing his
Mother-in-Law.
